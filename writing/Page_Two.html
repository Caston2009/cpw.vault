        <h2>Screen</h2>
        <p>		I had never put much thought into emotion. It was only recently that I found myself in a struggle, for everyone could see my feelings. There’s a screen on my chest. The screen is like a vintage television, but a little smaller to match the size of my chest. It responds to my emotion, but will occasionally show a memory or mental image of mine. I don’t remember how I got it. One day I just woke up with a screen on my chest and holes in my shirt. The screen had made it difficult to not express my emotion. Even covering it up was impossible, it would bleed through the darkest of blacks. I couldn’t be seen, so I decided to set myself apart from the outside world in fear of it knowing how I felt, knowing me. <br>
	
		One day I decided to go out. For the first time in nearly two years, I set foot outside my house by choice. I remember questioning myself for it shortly after. It wasn’t like it was for a doctor’s appointment or anything special like that. I don’t know why I did it, but I’m glad I did. The screen was my only fear, I didn’t want anyone to see it. I remember the day vividly, like the back of my hand. The smell of the fresh air the trees had created for me, the blue sky with fluffy clouds, and the shining bright sun. All reminders of how beautiful the world was. I must have looked like a goblin because people were looking at me again. I hope it wasn’t the screen.<br>
	When cars would drive by, I’d get a confused glance from everyone in the vehicle. Although I understood that look, I couldn’t help but to wonder why. Why judge someone? I walked two miles before I felt the emotion kick in, and during my walk everyone looked at me like an alien. The judgment overflowing, making me more depressed .Walking by people, they would hate on me, and question.<br>
	“Why does he look like that?” a little girl said to her mother.<br>
	“I don’t know, come on let’s leave,” she replied.<br>
	I continued my walk for another mile. Old friends from elementary school were outside. I tried to build up confidence, but I couldn’t.The idea of them running me off because of how I looked was aching. Now when I looked down and saw the screen it was an upset face, like an emoji but with its own unique differences. The screen continued with its nonsense and eventually changed stations. It was a memory. The memory of when my brother had left my family. I had felt as if I were the reason he left, but eventually that feeling faded a little. I think that at that moment, I felt lonely once more. This is why I don’t leave my house and see people, because if I don’t see people, then there will be no one to make me feel lonely—it makes me depressed. I wanted coffee, I was too tired, and the walk home seemed even more exhausting. When I walked into the local shop, I got gazed at. It felt like the few people in the room instantly started to judge. It always happens when the screen is showing how I feel. When I got to the front of the short line I looked at the menu. I wanted a mocha, and it was priced at $3.75 for a medium, which felt perfect.<br>
	“I’d like a medium mocha,” I said.<br>
	“Sure thing, that will be $3.75, would you like to leave a tip?” the barista asked; she was attractive.<br>
	“Why not.”<br>
	She took a second and looked at me. My face must have been weird looking, because she stared for a long time. It started to get uncomfortable.<br>
	“Is that a screen?” she asked.<br>
	“Y—yeah,” I responded, “It showed up one morning, it shows my emotion,”<br>
	“That’s so cool!” she said in a flirty tone.<br>
	It caught me by surprise. How could anyone find this cool? It’s a curse, everyone looks at me like I’m medusa.<br>
	“How is this cool?” I snapped. My screen turned angry, and sad. That’s new, it’s mixed.<br>
	“I just think it's uncommon. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you,” she said remorsefully.<br>
	“Well, thank you,” I said in an unmannered tone.<br>
	I went to sit down in the corner. I looked at my phone, it had been hours since I was last home, I figure I might as well go home soon. My phone read 3:46pm, but it felt earlier. The barista came over with my mocha and a small cookie.<br>
	“Here you go Mr.” she said.<br>
	“Thank you,” I said.<br>
	There’s a note attached to the coffee. The note said, “I’m extremely sorry that I made you like that, if you’re not against it, let me make it up to you. My number is 1-877-968-8491”. For the first time in forever my screen showed happiness. I put the note in my pocket, grabbed my coffee, left a $20 tip in her jar, and left. I had to walk three miles to get home. I wish I had a car. When I got home, my mother and father looked at me—the screen, I mean. They were happy. They’ve never seen it happy, nor had I. Confused, they briefly talked with me, and after a while I went to rest. As I went to lay down I remembered the note. I got back up and shuffled my pants to find it. I had to find the note—I needed to find it. That note was proof I could be happy.<br>
	I found it, it was under my books on my desk. I don’t remember leaving it there. I found it and entered it into my phone. 
	“Hey, I don’t know if you remember me, but I was the guy with the screen on my chest,” I said, “I was wondering if I could take you up on that offer”<br>
	“Of course I remember you, I’d love to do that,” she replied quickly.<br>
	We had made plans to go to a museum, although I was unsure what the museum was exactly for, I was extremely excited.
	“Make it a date,” she said.<br>
	My heart dropped, it would be the first time someone had taken me on a date. How would I tell my parents that I’ll be going on a date with someone. Just earlier today I went out for the first time in a long time, and now I have a real date with a real person. I feel like I could be loved, not judged and hated. My screen shows a large pink heart. I sure hope this works out, and to think, I was planning to end it soon.<br>
